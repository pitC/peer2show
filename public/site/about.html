  		  	<h4>What is Peershow?</h4>
  		  	<p>
  		  	Peer2show is a web service for ad-hoc peer-to-peer real-time slide shows. Unlike other available options it is <em> <strong>easy to use</em> </strong>,<em> <strong>interactive</em> </strong> and <em> <strong>secure </em> </strong>.
  		  	<br>All you need are three simple steps:
  		  	<ol>
  		  		<li><strong><em>Create</strong></em> a new session. No sign-up required, all you need is your name.
  		  		<li>Select images you'd like to show from your local disk and <strong><em>drag&drop</strong></em> to the show area.
  		  		<li><strong><em>Share</strong></em> the session with your friends. Just send them link uniquely assigned to your session. 
  		  	</ol>
  		  	Once your friends join the session, pictures will be sent <strong> <em> directly </em> </strong> to their browsers and cached there. The images are not uploaded to any server!
  		  	As you navigate through your show, current slide is displayed to all viewers, so you can be sure everyone is "on the same page".
  		  	When you're done and the session is closed, your pictures are not online anymore as they are not stored in the cloud.

			<h4>How does it work?</h4>
  		  	<p>
  		  	Peershow is based on WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) - an open framework for the web that enables Real Time Communications in the browser.
  		  	It includes the fundamental building blocks for high quality communications on the web such as network, audio and video components used in voice and video chat applications.
